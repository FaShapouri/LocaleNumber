A sample playground to locale number from En to Fa and Fa to En
Simple Extending to other languages

This sample is created to convert numbers in a combined string; As you know converting a digit number is really easy but when you try to convert a string contains characters and number it is going to make you nervous ;) This sample keeps you calm and let you have a nice development.
Any Way the sample converting result is here:



"۰۹۱۲123۴۵۶۷" —> "۰۹۱۲۱۲۳۴۵۶۷"

"fa.shapouri۱۲۳456" —> "fa.shapouri123456"


The Objective-c code will be updated as soon as possible…
